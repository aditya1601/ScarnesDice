If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the computer\'s turn.\n\n2.) If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player\'s turn continues.\n\n3.) If a player chooses to \"hold\", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the computer\'s turn.\n\n\nThe first player to score 100 or more points wins.\n\n\n : Press \"Play\" to Roll\n : Press \"Pause\" to Hold\n : Press \"Revert\" to Reset</string>
